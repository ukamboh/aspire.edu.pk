// In lines of code and moments passed,
// mistakes may fade, but lessons last.
// This project grew from errors wide,
// now guided by a second try.

// Where bugs once roamed and logic failed,
// new hope is built and debts are paid.
// For every fix, a step relearned,
// and every test, a truth discerned.

// So if you read this line today,
// know redemption lights the way.
// Not perfect yet â€” but better, kind,
// and moving forward, line by line.# aspire.edu.pk
